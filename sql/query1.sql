-- Q1) CREATE TABLE + INSERT:
-- Question: How can we create a new table of high-performing
-- students (GPA â‰¥ 3.7) based on their grades, and insert data into it?

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS high_performers;

-- Create the table with an explicit schema
CREATE TABLE high_performers (
  student_id   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  student_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  gpa          REAL NOT NULL
);

-- Insert rows meeting the GPA threshold
INSERT INTO high_performers (student_id, student_name, gpa)
WITH numeric_grades AS (
  SELECT
    e.student_id,
    CASE e.grade
      WHEN 'A'  THEN 4.0
      WHEN 'A-' THEN 3.7
      WHEN 'B+' THEN 3.3
      WHEN 'B'  THEN 3.0
      ELSE NULL
